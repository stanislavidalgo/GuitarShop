        Knowledge is key, experience is paramount. While learning from 1-on-1 lessons proves beneficial, neglecting the opportunity to learn from a variety of guitar pros is just ignorant. We spend most of our time hunting down new teachers, flying them to our filming

        studio, and presenting their knowledge to our members.

        We consistently film, edit and publish around 11 hours of new guitar lessons every 30 days; an enormous amount of material to keep your playing focused and interests perked. With new lessons added on a daily basis, you cannot

        find another company as dedicated to teaching the guitar as string.

        Features galore. While any dummy can film a few guitar lessons and toss together a website, few can compete with the range of features we have built for our members. From live instructor interaction to enharmonic scale diagrams, we take

        pride in offering you the best guitar learning website available. Period.
